  Bursting with imagery, motion, interaction and distraction though it is, today’s World Wide Web is still primarily a conduit for textual information. In HTML5, the **focus on writing and authorship** is more pronounced than ever. It’s evident in the very way that new elements such as `article` and `aside` are named. HTML5 asks us to treat the HTML document more as… well, a document.

  It’s not just the specifications that are changing, either. Much has been made of [permutations to Google’s algorithms](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/04/high-quality-sites-algorithm-goes.html), which are beginning to favor better written, more authoritative content (and making work for the growing [content strategy](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/thedisciplineofcontentstrategy/) industry). Google’s bots are now charged with [asking questions](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/05/more-guidance-on-building-high-quality.html) like, “Was the article edited well, or does it appear sloppy or hastily produced?” and “Does this article provide a complete or comprehensive description of the topic?,” the sorts of questions one might expect to be posed by an earnest college professor.
